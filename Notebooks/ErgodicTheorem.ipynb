    "Therefore, if the left-hand side can be numerically estimated, an estimation is automatically obtained\n",
    "for the ratio $\\omega(d)/\\omega(d-1)$. Since $\\omega(1)=2$, the above observation can help to inductively estimate the volume $\\omega(d)$ even for a large $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio $\\frac{|\\, D_{d}\\,|}{|\\, C_{d}\\,|}$ has been estimated by taking $N$ independent random points on the cylinder $C_{d}$ and counting how many (nhits) of them fell inside the ball $D_{d}$. The probability that a uniformly selected point from the cylinder $C_{d}$ falls into the ball $D_{d}$ is $\\frac{|\\, D_{d}\\,|}{|\\, C_{d}\\,|}$. Therefore, as a consequence of the **law of large numbers** the rate nhits/$N$ when the number of points $N$ is large is a good estimate of the ratio $\\frac{|\\, D_{d}\\,|}{|\\, C_{d}\\,|}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a point randomly from the cylinder it is sufficient to pick the first $d$ coordinates uniformly from the disk $D_{d-1}$ and the last coordinate uniformly from (-1,1). The second objective is a simple command. To achieve the first objective a Markovian chain is considered on the ball $D_{d-1}$ with a uniform invariant distribution on the ball $D_{d-1}$ for several (n) steps for it to come close to equilibrium. Therefore, a total of $n$ steps of the chain is necessary: to get each of the $N$ samples $n$ steps for the chain must be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ergodic theorem** is going to be used to calculate the ratio $\\frac{|\\, D_{d}\\,|}{|\\, C_{d}\\,|}$. In particular, a Markovian chain will be constructed on the cylinder $C_{d}$ with invariant distribution uniform. The ergodic theorem yields that the fraction of time the chain spends on the ball $D_d$ over time, approximates the weight that the invariant distribution gives to the ball $D_d$, i.e. the ratio $\\frac{|\\,D_d\\,|}{|\\, C_{d}\\,|}$. In order to compare with the results obtained from the law of large numbers,for $M=nN$ total steps of the chain on the cylinder $C_{d}$ the number of steps inside the ball $D_d$ will be counted. \n",
